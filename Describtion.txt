To develop a Python task management app that can add, remove, list, prioritize, and recommend tasks based on descriptions, we need to follow a structured approach. The following steps will guide the development process:

1. Define Task Structure: We'll create a 'Task' class to represent individual tasks.

2. Task Manager: We'll create a 'TaskManager' class to handle operations on tasks.

3. Main Application: The main application will use the 'TaskManager' to perform actions based on user input.

4. Recommendation System: Implement a simple recommendation system based on task descriptions.
